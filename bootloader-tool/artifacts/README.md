# Artifacts folder
This directory contains configuration assets used by SPSDK to generate key materials and signed master boot images.
Anything generated by SPSDK should be included in the `.gitignore` file and never committed to git.

In the future even the configuration files might also be auto-generated by the `ms-bootloader-tool`.
